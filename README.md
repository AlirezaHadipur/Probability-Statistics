Hi dear friends🖐.

Recently I attended a Probability and Statistics course because I'm eager for data science and I want to improve my skills in coding and visualizing data.

I learned the basics and theoretical concepts about probability and statistics, but I thought it would be helpful to implement whatever I learned throughout this course, so I decided to create this repository.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions or ideas that can help me to be a better data scientist .🧐😎
